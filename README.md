# hello-world
Let's start GitHub

Hey, I am currently taking a course on mechatronics my group and I are creating a project using an "induino" board.
We have a number of coding exercises assigned to us that we must complete.
Of course, Haran Rajkumar won't hand me his code using my pendrive because he's too cool for such a "primitive" device.
So, I had to create an account on GitHub.
GitHub, now you can sponsor Haran's projects to reward his loyalty.
Bless his soul.
